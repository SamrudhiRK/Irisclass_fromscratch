# Irisclass_fromscratch
This project implements a Decision Tree classifier from scratch to classify Iris flowers into three species based on sepal and petal features. The model uses Gini Impurity for splitting and evaluates performance on test data. 
# Decision Tree from Scratch for Iris Classification 

## Project Overview  
This project implements a **Decision Tree classifier from scratch** to classify **Iris flowers** into three species: **Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica**. The model is built using **recursive splitting** based on feature thresholds and evaluated using accuracy metrics.  


## Dataset  
The **Iris dataset** consists of:  
- **Sepal Length**  
- **Sepal Width**  
- **Petal Length**  
- **Petal Width**  
- **Target Variable:** Species (`Setosa`, `Versicolor`, `Virginica`)  

## Implementation Steps  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Splitting data into **training and test sets**  

2. **Decision Tree Algorithm**  
   - **Recursive splitting** using **Gini Impurity**  
   - Building a **tree structure** for classification  

3. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Measuring **accuracy** on test data  
   - Visualizing the **decision boundaries**  

## Requirements  
Install the required dependencies before running the notebook:  

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```


## Results & Insights  
- The **Decision Tree classifier successfully classifies Iris flowers**.  
- The model learns from **feature splits** and performs well on test data.  
- Decision boundaries demonstrate how different species are separated.
